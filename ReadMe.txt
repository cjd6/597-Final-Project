COMP 597 Final Project

In the Trainers directory, VGG Trainer.py, InceptionV3 Trainer.ipynb, and EfficientNetV2S Trainer.ipynb were used for training the models.

In the Models directory, VGGFinal.keras, Inceptionv3_Model.keras, and EfficientNet_v2S_Model.keras are the actual trained models.

VGGTrainingRecord.py was used to make the visualizations for VGG's training.

The files contained in the "Average" directory are for evaluating all combinations of models using the averaging method.

Combine.py is the program for running the models together and evaluating their individual and group performances on the testing data set for all combination methods except averaging.

Results.txt shows the results of running Combine.py on the testing data set.

Dataset is available at (link).
